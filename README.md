Now a days some projects are used to help others by enabling them to feel secure and safe. On  the other side other projects are using good intent to identify people and help offinsive forces to use that technology to kill and extort.

This project aims to counterpart bad use of tech by the use of AI and advanced tech based on opensource projects to hide distort data. Survielance that drives targeting on innocents is based on and distort data.

*Explaination*:

- Imagine a dvice that analyzes faces using fast algorithms that uses transformers to identify a target in no time
- This will in return identifies a target
- A geo location is then determined
- And an annocent is killed based on a stupid computation

*Aim*:

This project aims to come up with an idea to fight this back by distorting the type of data and block the use of such tech.
I don't think I can come up with this alone but I will need help and I'm sure bright minds out there can and will help.
