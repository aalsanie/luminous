**Luminous**

Shedding light on the dark side of technology.

Luminous is a research and advocacy project dedicated to uncovering how modern technologies — from data analytics to AI surveillance — are being weaponized against civilians, activists, and marginalized populations worldwide.

We believe in transparency, accountability, and digital human rights.

Our mission: to make the invisible visible — and to hold power to account.

Mission

Technology was meant to empower humanity.
Instead, it’s often used to monitor, manipulate, and harm.

Luminous exists to expose:

	•	The misuse of AI in autonomous weapons and predictive policing.
	•	Mass surveillance conducted under the guise of safety and innovation.
	•	The commodification of personal data, enabling tracking, profiling, and social control.
	•	Corporate complicity in human rights violations enabled by technological exports and opaque partnerships.

We illuminate what others obscure.

What We Do

	• Research & Documentation — Investigate how tech infrastructures are being used in harmful or unlawful ways.
	• Data Transparency Tools — Build and maintain open-source tools for verifying and visualizing hidden data flows.
	• Corporate Accountability Reports — Trace supply chains of software, sensors, and data brokers involved in human rights abuses.
	• Policy & Advocacy — Publish evidence-based recommendations for ethical and regulatory reform.
	• Whistleblower Support — Provide secure channels for disclosures of misuse and exploitation within big tech companies.

Why Luminous Exists

Every day, technologies designed for “efficiency” or “security” are deployed in ways that:

	•	Facilitate extrajudicial killings through automated targeting systems.
	•	Enable mass profiling of journalists, minorities, and refugees.
	•	Feed data to authoritarian regimes under the veil of “partnerships.”
	•	Allow private corporations to monitor, score, and exploit individuals for profit.

Luminous stands against this normalization of harm.

We are not anti-technology — we are pro-accountability.

⸻
Our Principles

	1.	Truth Before Profit — Public interest must outweigh commercial secrecy.
	2.	No Neutral Technology — Every design choice has moral weight.
	3.	Right to Privacy — Surveillance is violence when it silences.
	4.	Transparency by Default — Code, contracts, and consequences must be visible.
	5.	Ethics as Infrastructure — Safety and justice are not add-ons.
